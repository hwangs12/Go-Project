# Go-Project
This is game of go. Stone and board made from scratch by Brandon Kim. Further implemented by me Jun Hwang and supervised by William Kim.

This is an on-going project where function of the game and user interface will be improved as we go through. 

Currently, we should implement function for surrounding multiple stones and not just one. 

The game should be transformed into react component
